this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . the door would not close . i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . i am still trying to resolve it four months later . 
this thing plays everything i feed it . compusa , memorex , fuji . plays them all . i ordered 2 . 
door broke after a month . unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . forget about it . it 's money down the drain . get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys . 
well , it was nice while it lasted .
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display . it works great . i should have looked at it harder .
